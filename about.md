I am a **Postdoctoral researcher** in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner), working in collaboration with [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) on new ML methods for real-world applications. Previously I was part of the [Machine Learning Group](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/anc/research/machine-learning) at the University of Edinburgh with [Amos Storkey](https://www.bayeswatch.com/). I have been an intern at [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com) supervised by [Edward Rosten](https://www.edwardrosten.com/index.html) (inventor of the [FAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_from_accelerated_segment_test) algorithm), and a PhD student in robotics and machine learning at Plymouth University with [Angelo Cangelosi](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/angelo.cangelosi.html) and [Giorgio Metta](https://www.iit.it/people/giorgio-metta). I am interested in **Bayesian Methods**, **Deep Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**, in particular how to tie them together to have systems that are both efficient and flexible.

You can find a short **curriculum** on [my personal page](https://mpatacchiola.github.io) and an update list of my **publications** on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L4GcSrsAAAAJ&hl=en).
